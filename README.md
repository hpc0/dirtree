# dirtree
A lightweight Ruby CLI tool that displays the contents of a specified directory in a tree-like structure.

## Features

- **Clear, tree-like structure**: Easily visualize the hierarchy of files and directories.  
- **ASCII compatibility**: Use the `/A` flag for a tree view with standard ASCII characters, ensuring compatibility across all environments.  
- **Directory-only view**: Use the `/D` flag to display only directories.  
- **Plain text output**: Use the `/P` flag to disable color for a simpler, plain-text view. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:hpc0/dirtree.git
   cd dirtree
   ruby dirtree.rb [directory_path]

This will output a tree-like structure of the specified directory.
